## Work Experience
**Data Science Research Associate @ RTEMSoft Lab, Ontario Tech University, Canada (_June 2024 - Present_)**
Developing predictive solutions for Team Eagle Airfield operation software quality, hosted in the Azure cloud.
- Machine learning model for time-series prediction on software quality metrics, such as random forest, gradient boosting, and LSTM with backtesting.
-	Developing Grafana and customized dashboard for reporting and visualization.  

**Machine Learning Analytics Research Assistant @ IBM CAS, Canada (_May 2023 - _April 2024)**
Applied ML methods on a large-scale CI/CD dataset (approx. four million entries) to enhance test case prioritization technique. 
- Accelerated machine learning runtime by 60% using advanced continual learning algorithms and demonstrated A/B testing outcomes using Python graph plot libraries.
- Presented the novel technique results in the peer-reviewed [CCIW workshop] (https://conf.researchr.org/details/icst-2024/cciw-2024-papers/5/Replay-Based-Continual-Learning-for-Test-Case-Prioritization).
